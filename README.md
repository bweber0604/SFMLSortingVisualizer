# SFMLSortingVisualizer

this application shows a visualization of the bubble sort algorithm by showing the movement of bars representing data.


How To use It:
1.Press 'r' to randomize the set of data
2.Pressing the space bar will start the sort
3.hitting the up and down arrows on your keyboard will increase and decrease the amount of bars in the sorting sample size
4.the '+' and '-' keys will raise and lower the size of the bars respectively

this was my first bigger project using c++ and sfml

How To Run:

If you have it open in Visual Studio Code:
you need to type ./SortingApp.exe and the window should pop up. If you made changes to the code then you should MAKE the project to update the .exe

Otherwise all you need to do is double click the .exe file and it should open
